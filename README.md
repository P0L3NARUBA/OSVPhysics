# Warning
* You should expect some bugs that may appear, Because its not fully implemented.
* This project will never get an update.
* Use original **vphysics_client.so** or **vphysics.dll** closed-source library for the best experience.
* Physics are not importnant that you dont need the source code.
   * You can use **Ghidra** or **IDA Free** for Reverse Engineer it and modify these closed source libraries.
 
## Known Bugs in Kisak-Strike / CS:GO Source Code

### OSVPhysics
* Some objects has a weird physics, espicialy in cs_militia.
* Some props may be in a different place.
* If you shoot some big props too much, then it will fling.

### Kisak Physics
* Window parts is very buggy, they fly to void.
* A lot of maps crashing.

### Bullet Physics
* Missing Too much effects.
* Broken, just its good for ragdolls.
* Objects are acting very uglyish.


- Other than that, the best & much stable physics library is **Original VPhysics** (**vphysics_client.so** or **vphysics.dll**)
- Closed-Source but its better.
