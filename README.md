# Warning
* You should expect some bugs that may appear, Because its not fully implemented.
* This project will never get an update.
* Use original **vphysics_client.so** or **vphysics.dll** closed-source libraries/binaries for the best experience.
   * Since the physics are already sufficient and good, You dont need the Source Code.
      * You can use **Ghidra** or **IDA Free** for Reverse Engineer it and modify these closed source libraries.
      * Even without modifying, this proprietary binaries still very good.
   * I'm Even playing with the original vphysics, this repository is created just for research purposes.
