# Warning
* You should expect some bugs that may appear, Because its not fully implemented.
* This project will never get an update.
* Use original **vphysics_client.so** or **vphysics.dll** closed-source library for the best experience. (like im doing)
* Since the physics are already sufficient and good, You dont need the Source Code.
   * You can use **Ghidra** or **IDA Free** for Reverse Engineer it and modify these closed source libraries.
   * Even without modifying, this proprietary binaries is very good.
